# Full Stack Web Development - Lab 1: Testing, FizzBuzz, and Fibonacci #

Classic programming interview questions!

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account
   * Don't have a Github account? Go get one and then come back!
2. Clone the repository to your own machine

   Huh? What does that even mean? Short version: you need to create
   a copy of the code on your machine, and "cloning" is git's way of
   doing that.

   But where? Well, I like to set up a special directory on my machine
   to hold all my programming projects (`~/Code`). Just open up a terminal
   window and run `mkdir Code` on the prompt (`mkdir` = "Make directory").
   After you have done that, run `cd Code` to change to that directory and
   then run the git clone command.
3. After cloning, run `cd fswd-lab-1` to change your shell's working
   directory to your copy of the project.
4. Run `npm install` to install the node modules for the project, then
   `npm test` to run the tests.
5. Everything passes! Grab yourself a cookie; you're all done.
6. Yeah, I was kidding. You're not done at all!
7. Look at the files in the code. Tests are in `tests/` and the function
   skeletons are in `lib/`.
8. The first cases are implemented and tested (`fizzBuzz(0)` and `fib(0)`).
   Start by writing tests for the next case (1) and expand the function to
   handle it correctly.
9. Then 2, then 3, â€¦
